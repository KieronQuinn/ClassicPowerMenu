## Features

- Up to 10 power options in the Power Menu, including the non-stock options of Screenshot, Reboot Recovery and Reboot Bootloader
    - Fully customisable, including rearranging and hiding buttons you don't use

- Quick Access Wallet in the Power Menu, accessible while locked or unlocked
    - Optional blurring of card numbers while locked
    - Optional showing of loyalty cards, restoring a previous feature from Android 10 which was removed. Loyalty cards' codes can be shown while locked and without needing to open Google Wallet, if you wish.
    
- Device Controls in the Power Menu, accessible while locked or unlocked
    - Optional ability to interact with controls while locked, without requiring authentication
    
- Material You inspired theme, using Monet colours and background blur on the Power Menu

- Xposed is not required, interception of the power button is done via Accessibility Service, with only normal root required
    - An optional Xposed module is included, which can react quicker than the Accessibility Service
